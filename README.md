Collect the small multi-colored dots to grow in size. If you are smaller than the red enemey dots, avoid them becasue you will 
be eaten. You win the game once all of the enemy players have been eaten, so grow big enough to eat all the enemies. The green 
dots provide a safe place to hide, but only if you are smaller in size. If you are bigger, you will rapidly decrease in size.
